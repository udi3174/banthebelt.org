<h2> Child abuse is a very bad problem. Help us stop it at banthebelt.org. </h2>

<p> In 2010, over 1500 children have died because of any form of abuse. Some forms of abuse
are neglect, which is deliberately not meeting the minor's needs like healthcare, food, 
etc. Physical abuse is the second most common type of abuse and it is like beating up kids,
slapping them, and more.
